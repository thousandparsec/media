First, the comets, and the stars in which they fly are created in Maya.

I started by creating a comet I was happy with, using a particle emitter.
Once I was happy with it, I duplicated it, and connected it, and it’s
duplicate onto a path. The path is two spirals that connect into each
other. The two emitters are bound to the end of each end of the spiral, and
set to move towards the center at the same rate.

I then added the camera in, and played around with its movement until I was
happy with it.

I next created the stars for the background. These are in the same scene,
and are painted on using the 2d brush tool with a mixture of the two star
brushes. The nurb plane they’re painted on is displaced using a simple
cloudmap (quickly thrown together in Photoshop using the clouds/difference
clouds filter), and because of this, the stars are given some depth/height.

Both are rendered off separately. (Particles are hardware renderer only,
the stars, the software renderer.)

Both are imported into AfterFX.

I still wasn’t happy with the comet effects at this point, and added in
some particle effects over the top of them.  To create the explosion when
the two comets met, I had to use another piece of software called Particle
Illusions – this made the process of creating a good looking explosion much
more simple. I rendered this as a separate .avi file.

All other tweaks, etc, should be contained within the AfterFX, and Maya
files.
